"nginx-hard.conf" has been deprecated & merged into the "classic" config,
in order to simplify future development. If you are seeing this message,
please remove the following line:

    set nginx_template templates.d/nginx-hard.conf.txt

...from your configuration, and replace it with:

    set hard_mode 1

Apologies for the inconvenience.
