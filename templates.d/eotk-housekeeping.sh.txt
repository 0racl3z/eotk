# IMPORTANT: THIS SCRIPT MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY INSTALLED IN THE CRONTAB
# FOR %USER% ON EVERY MACHINE RUNNING EOTK IN THE SAME WORKER GROUP.

# The general thinking here is:
#
# 1) you create the script by using:
#
#   eotk make-scripts
#
# 2) insert the following command into the cron file for user "%USER%"
#
#  00 08 * * 1 exec %EOTK_HOME%/eotk-housekeeping.sh
#
# ...a slight delay is automatically added for OnionBalance machines

EOTK_HOME=%EOTK_HOME%
EOTK_USER=%USER% # hardcode owner of the directory & files
EOTK_HOUSEKEEPING_LOG=/tmp/eotk-housekeeping.log
EOTK_OB_DELAY=90 # backgrounded pause

EOTK_PATH=%PATH% # freeze the path at template expansion time (not wise for init-script)

exec </dev/null >>$EOTK_HOUSEKEEPING_LOG 2>&1

PATH="$EOTK_PATH" ; export PATH

    echo "error: please fix this else logs will not be rotated."
    exit 1
