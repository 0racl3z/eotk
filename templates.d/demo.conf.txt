#################### hardmap examples ####################

# hardmap is designed to run on a single machine, for protoyping,
# testing, or for small deployments.

# in hardmap a `project` contains onion services with pre-established
# ("hard coded") onion keys, and a single tor daemon (per project)
# feeds requests for 1/more onion addresses into nginx, which remaps
# and rewrites them, passing the request onto the backend website.

# "default" project

################################################################

# softmap is designed to run on 1-or-more machines, and requires
# `onionbalance` to synthesise tor multiprocessing, providing an
# enterprise-scalable means for onionsite provisioning.

# the result is an expandable and highly available "cloud" of tor
# servers which can support mapping of several/tens/scores of domains
# simultaneously for hundreds to thousands of simultaneous users.

# in softmap, instead of a `project` creating onion services with
# pre-established keys, softmap projects use many, independent tor
# daemons, each of which creates a self-chosen, random address.

# a single nginx (per machine) listens to all to all of the tor
# daemons in a given softmap project, and it services the HTTP
# requests sent to any/all of them; since nginx already understands
# multiprocessing (see `nginx_workers`) this is okay.

# a softmap project may be replicated (rsync? docker?) to several
# machines in a cloud, providing linear scalability; all that remains
# is for onionbalance to be configured with the "random" onion
# addresses of the cloud's tor daemons, and for it to republish them
# under (a) "service" onion address(es).

# it is important for efficiency and security to not replicate the
# per-tor-worker private tor keys, as these serve like the unique
# worker IP addresses in a traditional TCP/IP load-balancer setup;
# instead each softmap instance should choose its own keys, which
# should subsequently be configured into onionbalance.

# onioncloud: 7x servers, each with 4 cores => 28 cores

set project onioncloud

# softmap only: per-host-per-project number of tor workers; tor is
# very efficient, so this generally does not have to be a big number.
# also: this number will be multiplied by the number of times you
# deploy the project, ie: this number in each machine or container.

set softmap_tor_workers 4

# softmap only: the per-host-per-project number of nginx workers per
# machine or container; let's guess "5x per tor worker" => 5 * 4 = 20;
# possibly a bigger multiplier - 7x? 10x? - may eventually be needed.

set softmap_nginx_workers 20
